# DE-LIMP TODO

## Phosphoproteomics — Phase 2 (Kinase Activity & Motifs)
- [ ] **KSEA integration** (`KSEAapp` CRAN package): Infer upstream kinase activity from phosphosite fold-changes using PhosphoSitePlus + NetworKIN database. Horizontal bar plot of kinase z-scores.
- [ ] **Sequence logo / Motif analysis** (`ggseqlogo` CRAN package): Extract ±7 flanking residues around significant phosphosites, display as sequence logos. Requires FASTA upload.
- [ ] **Kinase Activity tab** in phospho results navset: Run KSEA button, bar plot, results table
- [ ] **Motif Analysis tab** in phospho results navset: Logos for up/down regulated sites
- [ ] Dockerfile: Add `KSEAapp`, `ggseqlogo` to CRAN install list

## Phosphoproteomics — Phase 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] **Protein-level abundance correction**: Subtract protein logFC from phosphosite logFC
- [ ] **PhosR integration** (Bioconductor): RUVphospho normalization, kinase-substrate scoring
- [ ] **AI context for phospho**: Append phosphosite DE results and KSEA kinase activities to Gemini chat
- [ ] **Phospho-specific FASTA upload**: Map peptide-relative positions to protein-relative positions

## MOFA2 — Next Steps
- [ ] **MEFISTO integration**: Temporal/spatial MOFA for time-course experiments
- [ ] **Factor annotation**: Link factors to GO terms based on top weights
- [ ] **DIA-NN report processing**: Process raw DIA-NN .parquet as MOFA view via existing pipeline
- [ ] **Dockerfile**: Add MOFA2 + basilisk to Docker image

## Core Facility Mode — Next Steps
- [ ] **QC run ingestion**: Auto-record QC metrics when loading HeLa digest report.parquet
- [ ] **Report template polish**: Add GSEA section, MOFA variance explained, configurable logo/header
- [ ] **Report comparison**: Side-by-side QC bracket + DE summary for two reports
- [ ] **HF state upload/download**: Upload `.rds` state to HF Spaces for shareable live links
- [ ] **Template application on search submit**: Auto-apply saved search preset
- [ ] **Audit log**: Track who generated which report, when, with what parameters
- [ ] **Multi-instrument QC alerts**: Flag instruments where protein count drops below rolling mean - 2*SD
- [ ] **End-to-end testing**: Test full flow with real DIA-NN search → QC ingest → report generation

## DIA-NN Search
- [ ] **End-to-end Docker testing**: Test full Docker submit → monitor → auto-load flow with real data

## General
- [ ] Grid View: Open violin plot on protein click with bar plot toggle
- [ ] Publication-quality plot exports (SVG/PNG/TIFF with size controls)
- [ ] Sample correlation heatmap (QC Plots tab)
- [ ] Venn diagram of significant proteins across comparisons
- [ ] Sample CV distribution plots
- [ ] Protein numbers bar plot per sample
- [ ] Absence/presence table for on/off proteins
